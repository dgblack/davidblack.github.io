# Snowspines Inc. - The eSki

I am co-founder and lead engineer / CTO of a small startup working on a novel system for ski touring. We hold two provisional patents in different "stride-assist" mechanisms for ski touring. Similar to pedal assist on an eBike, the "eSki" senses when the ski tourer initiates a stride and instantly provides a powerful pull to lift the heel of the boot. This greatly increases the ease, length, and speed of the stride and subsequent glide, thus increasing efficiency and allowing the skier to reach, explore, and ski new, more remote areas faster and with less effort.  

During my role here, I took the project from concept to actual physical product which is now being fabricated and tested for production. I carried out almost all the mechanical, electrical, and software development. I designed the mechanical components, performing FEA and simulations to optimize their weight and loading capabilities, helped create a custom controller PCB and power system, and wrote firmware and software to control it, including an Android app. In addition, I am involved in all the decisions on company direction, and have recruited and helped hire several employees and engineers.
