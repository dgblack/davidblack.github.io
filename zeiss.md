## Carl Zeiss Meditec AG Internship
##### Date: January 2018 - April 2019

I did a 4-month coop in the Advanced Development department at Carl Zeiss Meditec AG in Oberkochen Germany. Here I worked in a small team on a new technology in the field of quantitative fluorescence microscopy. This involved lab research and design work in the fields of optics and biophotonics, as well as programming and data analysis using computer vision, image processing, and augmented reality, predominantly in MATLAB. Upon completion of the 4-month internship, I was hired through Zeiss Canada to continue work on the project (40 hrs per month).

Unfortunately, I cannot give much detail or any pictures here as the work is classified. During my internship, I presented my work on multiple occasions to a panel of neurosurgeons, to the physicists and engineers of the Advanced Development department, and to company leadership. I travelled to MÃ¼nster twice for meetings and to modify a device we were performing research with. I was also flown to Oberkochen for a week in February 2019 to wrap up some work and discuss next steps. 

<!-- I have been invited to come back and work for Zeiss at any time. -->

#### Publications
At the end of the co-op, I wrote a ~50 page report outlining our findings, remaining questions, next steps, and usage instructions so future people can continue the project. I also left almost 300 pages of documentation, notes, and logs from experiments. Finally, I was involved in a few publications from the project. For these publications, I helped design and build the measurement device, as well as write all the analysis software and analyse multiple terabytes of data.
