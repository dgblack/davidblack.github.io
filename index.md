My name is David Black. I am a 4th-year undergraduate student in Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. I am passionate about robotics and medical physics, and have various work and project experiences in both. Through Engineering Physics coupled with my project work, I have gained a breadth of skills in software, mechanical, and electrical engineering, as well as a strong background in mathematics and physics. This unique skillset is ideal for robotics or medical physics applications and gives me a diverse knowledge of all aspects of the project so that I can jump in anywhere and communicate between all three disciplines of engineers as well as physicists.

Below is a list of my experiences, education, etc.
