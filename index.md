I am a PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada with an interest for robotics and medical imaging, and various work and project experiences in both. Through my background in Engineering Physics coupled with my project work, I have gained a breadth of skills in software, mechanical, and electrical engineering, as well as a strong background in mathematics and physics. This unique skillset is ideal for robotics or medical imaging applications and gives me a diverse knowledge of all aspects of the project so that I can jump in anywhere and communicate between all three disciplines of engineers as well as physicists.

Additionally, I am an avid skier, paragliding pilot, climber, and canyoneer ([View some highlights](https://dgblack.github.io/portfolio/adventure)). I am fluent (written and spoken) in English and German, play cello, follow the Bundesliga and Premier League, and love to travel. I am an efficient, motivated, hard worker and fast learner, and work well on teams. Below is a list of my experiences, education, etc.

I was featured in [this article](https://ece.ubc.ca/ece-student-perspectives-david-black-bmiai-fall-research-award-winner/?fbclid=IwAR1Xr2VrHbqTaCD4BnqhBOcMMts9JjDCCYInPcltPPRWH-0Gymz0uS8CPAQ) by UBC Electrical and Computer Engineering.
