Hi, I'm David Black. I am a 4th-year undergraduate student in Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada with a passion for robotics and medical physics, and various work and project experiences in both. Through Engineering Physics coupled with my project work, I have gained a breadth of skills in software, mechanical, and electrical engineering, as well as a strong background in mathematics and physics. This unique skillset is ideal for robotics or medical physics applications and gives me a diverse knowledge of all aspects of the project so that I can jump in anywhere and communicate between all three disciplines of engineers as well as physicists.

Additionally, I am an avid skier, climber, and canyoneer (View some highlights [here](https://dgblack.github.io/portfolio/adventure)). I play cello, follow the Bundesliga and Premier League, and love to travel. I am an efficient, motivated, hard worker and fast learner, and work well on teams. Below is a list of my experiences, education, etc.
