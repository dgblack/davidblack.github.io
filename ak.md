# A&K Robotics - Robotics Engineer Intern
##### Date: May - August 2020

A&K Robotics is a Vancouver-based startup which specializes in autonomous mobile robots. The hardware team consisted of one electrical engineer, one mechanical engineer, and myself. During my 4 months at the company we were tasked with designing from scratch two separate mobile robots, and implementing substantial changes to two more. I effectively worked as a third, equal member of the hardware team, and contributed substantially to each project.  

This involved mechanical and electrical design and some simulation on MATLAB and Python. For example, I designed a full drive and suspension system, a robotic arm end effector, complex electronics enclosures, chassis and shells of robots, electronics layouts, PCBs, and more. Much of the work was carried out under considerable time pressure, and with a focus not only on functionality, but on form and aesthetic for the customer. I worked many 16+ hour days, and learned a lot about product development, fabrication methods, and mobile robots, as well as of course mechanical and electrical design. One fabrication method I was particulary involved with was 3D printing. Through this experience I have become very adept at designing for 3D printers (as well as sheet metal, CNC, waterjet, and general machining), and at troubleshooting and modifying 3D printers.

Floor UV Disinfection System I designed for Fetch robot:

Design for form as well as function.

The 3D printers I managed, modified, disassembled and reassembled, etc.

Looking under the seat of a mobile I helped. The electronics and batteries were subsequently placed in this space. The drivetrain is visible in the base.

Actuated robot head I designed with depth and RGB cameras.
