## Robotics and Control Lab Coop
#### Date: May - December 2019

I did an 8 month internship in Dr. Tim Salcudean’s lab at the University of British Columbia in 2019, working towards a haptic feedback system for the da Vinci surgical robot. I redesigned the wrist of the master arm to integrate a force sensor with minimal impact on the robot’s kinematics or dynamics. I also implemented various experiments and applications using the design and the robot’s complex teleoperation and control systems. This involved mechanical and electrical design and prototyping, working with Robot Operating System (ROS), C++, Python, and MATLAB, as well as kinematics, and dynamic model identification. I also helped design a real-time communication and control system for a novel 6-axis force/torque sensor with IMU and temperature sensing.
