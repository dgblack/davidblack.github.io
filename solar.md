# UBC Solar Car - Vehicle Dynamics Team Lead

UBC Solar Car Team is a student engineering design team dedicated to creating a fully solar powered car to race at the Formula Sun Grand Prix. I was on the team in my first and second year of engineering. I quickly became vehicle dynamics team lead, a team of 4 taking care of suspension, steering, and braking. 

In this position, I learned about project management, vehicle dynamics, applying for funding, and CAD and simulation software. I designed the suspension and steering systems of the car and used ANSYS simulation software to do Finite Element Analysis impact and structural simulations of the entire car chassis as well as Computational Fluid Dynamics of the aeroshell aerodynamics.
