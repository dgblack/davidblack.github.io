# BC Cancer Research Centre Thermal Cycler
##### Date: August 2019

I helped with a project to develop a miniature thermal cycler for precise temperature control of nanolitre volumes. The device was designed for a cellenONE single cell isolator and dispenser. I helped with the electrical design and control of the system, which involved PID control of two Peltier modules, fans, and a water cooling system, controlled by an Arduino. Additionally, I developed a graphical user interface with a backend system which allowed the user to enter a series of times and temperatures, which were input into Arduino code and automatically flashed to the Arduino.
