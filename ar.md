# Human Teleoperation: A Haptically-Enabled Mixed Reality System for Teleultrasound
#### Date: July 2020 - Present

Please see my short introductory [video](https://youtu.be/44NBgDdrxhU).

This project involves a novel concept in the field of telemedicine. We have filed a provisional patent, submitted a [paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Human_Teleoperation_-_A_Haptically_Enabled_Mixed_Reality_System_for_Teleultrasound/15175869/1) to HCI which is under review, and have been accepted for a podium presentation at the Hamlyn Symposium for Medical Robotics, Imperial College, London. 

I presented this work to Prof. Nassir Navab's groups at TU Munich (TUM) and Johns Hopkins (JHU), as well as Prof. Emad Boctor's lab at JHU. I also presented to a panel of judges who awarded me the BC Medical Device Design Centre Innovation Prize, and to the UBC Biomedical Imaging and AI Cluster Fall Research Showcase, where I also won the 3 minute thesis award. 

Finally, I shared the project at two Rogers-UBC collaboration workshops with UBC professors and Rogers experts, and applied for a grant to collaborate with and be funded by Rogers. We have now been awarded the grant as well as MITACS funding. The project is being undertaken under the supervision of Prof. Tim Salcudean of the Robotics and Controls Lab, UBC.
