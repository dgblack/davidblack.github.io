# Human Teleoperation: A Haptically-Enabled Mixed Reality System for Teleultrasound
#### Date: July 2020 - Present

This project involves a novel concept in the field of telemedicine. We have filed a provisional patent and submitted a [paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Human_Teleoperation_-_A_Haptically_Enabled_Mixed_Reality_System_for_Teleultrasound/15175869/1). I presented this work to Prof. Nassir Navab's groups at TU Munich (TUM) and Johns Hopkins (JHU), as well as Prof. Emad Boctor's lab at JHU. I also presented to a panel of judges who awarded me the BC Medical Device Design Centre Innovation Prize, and to the UBC Biomedical Imaging and AI Cluster Fall Research Showcase, where I also won the presentation award. Finally, I shared the project at two Rogers' collaboration workshops with UBC professors and Rogers' experts, and applied for a grant to collaborate with and be funded by Rogers'. We have now been awarded the grant as well. The project is being undertaken under the supervision of Prof. Tim Salcudean of the Robotics and Controls Lab, UBC.
