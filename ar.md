# Registration and Overlay of 3D MRI to Patient for Robotic Surgery Planning
#### Date: July 2020 - Present

The goal of this project is to use a Microsoft HoloLens 2 to facilitate surgical planning and tool insertion for robotic minimally invasive surgery, as well as potentially other procedures such as needle biopsies. Using computer vision to recognize the patient's body and register 3D MRI imagery to it, the application will effectively let the doctor 'see inside' the patient to get a better idea of tumor location, internal anatomy, optimal incision location or needle insertion, etc.. This project is being undertaken under the supervision of Prof. Tim Salcudean of the Robotics and Controls Lab, UBC.
