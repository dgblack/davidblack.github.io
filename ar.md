# Haptically-Enabled Mixed Reality Medical Procedures
#### Date: July 2020 - Present

This project involves a completely novel concept in the field of telemedicine. We are currently working with the UBC University-Industry Liaison Office (UILO) to file a provisional patent. I presented this work to Prof. Nassir Navab and his groups at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for potential collaboration. I also presented to a panel of judges who are prominent in the medical tech startup scene in British Columbia, and was awarded the Medical Device Design Centre Innovation Award. The project is being undertaken under the supervision of Prof. Tim Salcudean of the Robotics and Controls Lab, UBC.
