## Engineering Physics Robot Course (ENPH 253)
# Date: July-August 2018

In this intensive course we were given 6 weeks to build an autonomous robot that performs a variety of challenging tasks. On competition day, our robot was the only one of 20 to complete all the tasks and score full marks. Please see my team's website for more information and videos of the robot in action:
