# Robotic, Anthorpomorphic PET Phantom

For my first capstone project (engineering physics' analogue to a thesis project in an honors physics degree, except we do two), I worked in a team of three with the BC Cancer Research Centre. We designed and built a robotically actuated, physiologically accurate, anthropomorphic phantom for use in PET motion correction studies. This involved mechatronic design, fluid dynamics, and PET physics, as well as project management skills in an interdisciplinary team of engineers, biologists, and physicists.
